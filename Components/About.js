            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>For the last 6 years, I was working for customer service positions for e-commerce companies and while these roles did provide me with a lot of personable and collaborative skills, I wanted to take on a new career path and I found myself looking into software engineering. 

            After taking a course through my local community college on Python and a prep course in JavaScript, I soon gained an interest and I started looking into different programs that could take me to the next level. Upon recommendation from my friend, I applied for the Grace Hopper Web Development bootcamp. While in the bootcamp, we were taught about back-end development, with Express and Sequelize, and front-end development, with React and React-Redux, to gain an understanding in full stack development.
            

            After graduating from the bootcamp, I have learned a lot more about JavaScript, React, Redux, Express, and Sequelize while I went through the bootcamp and I am now looking forward to taking all of my newfound skills and start my engineering career.
